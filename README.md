## (I stoped update here, now just in my private repository)

It's not working yet.

>Compiled with C++11 and need opencv Library

>This software contains a function to open a image data base. For images to be opened, it have to be in a folder into the project, where, there is in  [/Holes_Detection/Weightless_Neural_Network/dataBaseImages]().

> When salved in Json, the path files go to [/Holes_Detection/Weightless_Neural_Network/JsonFiles/]()

>To init first you have choose a image and after draw a rect using the mouse then you will press *ok* to set values, so you can start a train or a operating.

>NOTE: To delete a rectangle drawed enough click on the chose and press *del* in keyboard. And when you want create a new rectangle you can press only *n* in keyboard, but just if the size of already is setted within descriptor class;
